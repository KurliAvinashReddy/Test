# Simple Interest Calculator

This project is a simple program that calculates **Simple Interest** based on user-provided inputs.

## Formula

Simple Interest is calculated using the formula:

SI = (P × R × T) / 100


Where:
- **P** = Principal amount  
- **R** = Rate of interest per year  
- **T** = Time period (in years)

## Features

- Accepts principal, rate of interest, and time as input
- Calculates and displays simple interest
- Easy to understand and beginner-friendly

## Usage

1. Enter the principal amount  
2. Enter the rate of interest  
3. Enter the time period  
4. The program computes and displays the simple interest

## Example

**Input:**
Principal = 1000
Rate = 5
Time = 2

**Output:**
Simple Interest = 100


## Purpose

This project is intended for learning basic programming concepts such as:
- Input and output
- Arithmetic operations
- Basic formula implementation
